A part of the Large Language Models course in college.

This project involves building a large language model (LLM) powered by BERT to analyze crime and detective stories. The model processes story narratives, identifies key events, character interactions, 
and clues, and predicts the most probable culprit based on the textual evidence. By leveraging BERT's contextual understanding capabilities, the model provides a sophisticated analysis of the story's 
structure and deduces logical conclusions, mimicking a detective's reasoning process.

This tool demonstrates the application of natural language processing in creative and analytical domains, offering a unique blend of AI-driven storytelling and problem-solving.
